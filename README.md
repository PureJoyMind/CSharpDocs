# C\# Docs
These are my personal documents which I have written when watching or reading new stuff about C\#. 
They start from the beginning of the language and have an order.
This course starts from beginning to advanced.
You can use these if you want to recollect your existing data and need a refresher.

## How To Use
Go to the `CSharp` folder. all the `.md` files are there. 
I have checked all the files for typos but notify me if you find any.
There are to folders: mosh, essential csharp
Each is for a different learning material. 
## Sources
The first source of these notes is Mosh Hamedani's course. I highly recommend it because he covers all the useful data needed to deliver real world projects.
The course begins from basic syntax to advance Object Oriented Programming concepts. This course is good enough to get you started on the language.

For a deeper understanding of cSharp you obviously have to look at some good books. I am reading the book "Essential CSharp" which covers all the syntax and special cases in CSharp.

It took considerable time writing these. Use them to your liking!
