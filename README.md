# C\# Docs
These are my personal documents which I have written when watching or reading new stuff about C\#. 
They start from the beginning of the language and have an order.
You can use these if you want to recollect your existing data and need a refresher.

## Sources
The main source of these notes is Mosh Hamedani's course. I highly recommend it because he covers all the usefull data needed to deliver real world projects.
The course begins from basic syntax to advance Object Oriented Programming concetps.

***
It took considerable time writing these. use them to your liking!
