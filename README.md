# C\# Docs
These are my personal documents which I have written when watching or reading new stuff about C\#. 
They start from the beginning of the language and have an order.
This course starts from beginning to advanced.
You can use these if you want to recollect your existing data and need a refresher.

## Sources
The main source of these notes is Mosh Hamedani's course. I highly recommend it because he covers all the usefull data needed to deliver real world projects.
The course begins from basic syntax to advance Object Oriented Programming concetps.

## Finished 
I have finished my course. I am going for ASP.NET but I will not upload in this repo. I will create a new repo for that.

***
It took considerable time writing these. Use them to your liking!
