# Asynchronous

## Synchronous

The program is executed line by line.
When a function is called, program execution has to wait until the function returns. These are called ***Blocking operations***

* * *

When a function is called, program execution continuous to the next line without waiting for the function to complete.

We use asynchronous programming for:

- Accessing the web
- Working with files and databases
- Working with images

# How

We have traditional approaches:

- Multi-threading
- Callbacks

Both these approaches are complex to understand.

And since .NET 4.5:

- Async/Await or Task-based async

Most blocking operations in .NET also have an async version and they all end with the `async` suffix. If the async version also had a `TaskAsync` version, this means that the `async` one is legacy and we should use the `TaskAsync` version

# Making an async method

When making an async method there are some rules we have to follow:

1.  All asyncronous methods should have the `async` keyword after the access modifier.
2.  Their return type should be `Task`
3.  By convention the methods name should end with `async`. like: `DbWorkAsync()`
4.  Typically when calling async methods, we use the `await` keyword before the call. This is not a must and depends on the implementation.
5.  Wherever method we call an async method in, should be `async`

A `Task` is an object that encapsulates the state of async operation. It has 2 forms:

- Generic: for when our async operation returns a value, we give the value to the generic
- Non generic: for when it returns void.

Tasks return `Task` objects.

In `async` method calls, the compiler identifies the keyword as a costly operation. So instead of blocking the thread the control will be immediately returned to the caller.
When the async operation is complete, the runtime will be aware of it and the control returns to the rest of the async method.

***Note***: If we don't use the `await` keyword in an async call, that call will return a `Task` rather than the expected type.

So we can store `Task` types separately. Then whenever we want to use them we have to use `await`.
Basically, we don't always have to `await` an async operation. We can do some unrelated work in between that is not dependent on the result of that async operation.

# Async/Await vs Multi-threading and Callbacks

Whether to use async/await or multi-threading and callbacks depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your application.

Async/await is a newer and more convenient way to write asynchronous code in C#, and it has some advantages over traditional multi-threading and callbacks. With async/await, you can write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code, making it easier to reason about and debug. Async/await also allows you to avoid the overhead of creating and managing threads, which can improve performance and reduce resource usage.

However, there are some cases where multi-threading and callbacks may still be the better choice. For example, if you need to perform CPU-bound work that can benefit from parallelism, you may want to use multi-threading to take advantage of multiple cores. If you are working with legacy code or third-party libraries that use callbacks, you may need to use callbacks for interoperability. In some cases, using a combination of async/await, multi-threading, and callbacks may be the most appropriate approach.

Ultimately, the choice between async/await and multi-threading and callbacks depends on your specific requirements and constraints. It's important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and choose the one that best fits your needs.
