# What are Lambda Expressions
An anonymous method that has:
* No access modifier
* No name
* No return statement

We use them for convenience.
The syntax for them is: `args => expression`
`() => ...`
`x => ...`
`(x, y, z) => ...`

we have to assign lambdas to a delegate.

`Func<int, int> square = number => number * number;`

Lambda has access to its own scope where it is defined.

# Usecase
Some methods in C# need a `Predicate<T>`. A `predicate` is basically is delegate which points to a method that gets a `T` type and returns a `bool` specifying if a condition was satisfied.
Basically its checks for a condition.
All `Find()` methods accept a predicate.

```C#
var books = new Books().GetBooks(); // populates a Book list with some books
var cheapBooks = books.FindAll(book => Price < 10);
```
