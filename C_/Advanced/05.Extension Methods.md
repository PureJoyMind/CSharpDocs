# What are Extension Methods

These methods allow us to add methods to an existing class without changing its source code or creating a new class that inherits from it.

To create an extension method:

1.  Create a `static` class.
2.  Name it `class you're extending + Extensions`
3.  All methods should be `public` and `static`
4.  The first argument of the method should always be: `this ExtendingType name`

We can create extension methods inside `System` namespace so that they are loaded anywhere we need them.

****Note***: Instance methods have priority over static methods, so if a method with our extended methods name already exists it will be over written.

We will be using extended methods more than creating them.
