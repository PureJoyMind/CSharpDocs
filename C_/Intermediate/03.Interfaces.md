# Interfaces

They are a language construct that are similar to a class in terms of syntax but are fundamentally different.

An interface defines what a class must do, but not how it should do it.

```c#
public interface IShape
{
    int Draw();
}
```

All interfaces start with the letter `I`.
Unlike classes, interfaces do not have an implementation.
Interface members ***do not*** have access modifiers.

They help building loosely coupled apps.

Interfaces are used to define a contract that specifies a set of members that a class must implement, but they don't provide any implementation details themselves. Fields, on the other hand, are used to store data and provide implementation details, which is not part of the contract that an interface defines.

To implement an interface, a class must provide an implementation for all members of the interface.

# Difference between Abstract Classes and Interfaces

In C#, both interfaces and abstract classes can be used to define abstract types, but they serve different purposes and have different characteristics.

An interface in C# is a contract or a set of rules that define a set of method signatures, properties, and events that a class must implement if it implements that interface. An interface does not contain any implementation of the members it defines. Instead, it provides a way to specify a common behavior or functionality that can be shared by different classes. Multiple interfaces can be implemented by a class, allowing it to provide different sets of functionality to different clients.

On the other hand, an abstract class in C# is a class that cannot be instantiated directly, and it may contain both abstract and non-abstract members. Abstract classes can be used as a base class for other classes to inherit from, and they provide a way to define a common behavior or functionality that can be shared by all derived classes. Abstract methods, which are defined without an implementation, must be implemented by any non-abstract derived class. Non-abstract methods can also be defined in an abstract class and can be used to provide a default implementation for the derived classes to override if needed.

In summary, while both interfaces and abstract classes can be used to define abstract types in C#, interfaces define a contract for behavior that must be implemented by a class, while abstract classes provide a base class that can be inherited from and may provide both abstract and non-abstract members with default implementations.

Interfaces in C# cannot contain fields, only method signatures, properties, indexers, and events.

If you need to define a field in an interface-like structure, you can use a property instead. A property can have a getter and/or setter, which allows you to read and/or write a value to the property, similar to a field.

```c#
interface IMyInterface
{
    int MyProperty { get; set; } // property instead of a field
}

class MyClass : IMyInterface
{
    public int MyProperty { get; set; } // implement the property
}

```

# Interfaces and Inheritance

Interfaces are not like inheritance. In interfaces we have to implement each method in its implemented class. This way, actually nothing is being inherited. Just the basic outline of what that interface must do.
