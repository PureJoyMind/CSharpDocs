# Interfaces
They are a language construct that are similar to a class in terms of syntax but are fundamentally different.

```c#
public interface IShape
{
	int Draw();
}
```

All interfaces start with the letter `I`.
Unlike classes, interfaces do not have an implementation. 
Interface members ***do not*** have access modifiers.

They help building loosely coupled apps.
