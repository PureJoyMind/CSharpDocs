# Anatomy Of a Class

- Data (Represented by fields)
- Behavior (Represented by methods)
    Objects are an instance of a class in the memory.

## Class members

- Instance: Accessible from an object:
    `personVar.Introduce();`
- Static: Accessible from the class:
    `Console.Write();`

We use static members for singleton concepts.
\*\*\* The Static keyword comes after the access modifier. ***

## Constructor

It is a method that is called when an instance of a class is created.
A parameter less constructor is called a ***Default Constructor***. If we don't define a default constructor for our class, the C# compiler will make one.
It will be in the IL. The auto generated constructor will initialize the fields to their default values. Numbers to zero and Booleans to false. All reference types are set to null and characters are set to empty character.

***NOTE***: As a general rule, whenever we have a list in our class, It is best to always initialize it to an empty list ourself. Because it will cause errors if we don't.

We can overload the constructor to have different parameters.

### This

`this` references the current object.
another use of `this` is when we need to initialize something in our constructor but we want all it's overloads to have that. Instead of copying our initialization to every overload, we do this:

```c#
public class Customer
{
      public int Id;
      public string Name;
      public List<Order> Orders;

      public Customer() // default constructor
      {
          Orders = new List<Order>();
      }

      public Customer(int id) // Gives the id an initial value
          : this()
      {
          this.Id = id;
      }
      public Customer(int id, string name) // sets id and name's initial value
          : this(id)
      {
          this.Name = name;
      }
}
```

This syntax calls the default constructor before calling the overload.
We can also call other constructors with `: this()`. Like the third constructor calls the second constructor when called to get the id then runs itself.
***This method is not the best practice and it is best to avoid if possible!***

## Object Initializers

Besides constructors we can also use these to initialize our objects.
An ***Object Initializer*** is a syntax for quickly initializing an object without the need to call one its constructors.
We use them to avoid creating multiple constructors. OI syntax is like this:

```c#
// Object initializer syntax
var customer = new Customer
{
    Id = 5,
    Name = "maz"
};
```

When initializing an obj like this, the default constructor is going to be called then these values are set.

## Methods

- Method signature: the signature of a methods consists of a ***name*** and ***the number and type of parameters***
- Method Overloading: Having a signature with the same name and different parameters.

### Method Modifiers

#### Params

Some times when overloading, our parameters have the same type but vary in their numbers. for example a method can be initialized with 1 number up to 10 numbers. We can cerate 10 constructors here but just NO.
A way to achieve this is using arrays:

```
public class Calculator
{
  public int Add(int[] numbers){}
}
```

But every time we want to create an instance of this class we need to create and initialize an array.
`var result = calculator.Add( new int[] {1, 2, 5, 6} )`
To avoid this and use a better way we use the `params` modifier:

```
public class Calculator
{
  public int Add(params int[] numbers){}
}
```

Now we can use this method both with `new` keyword like before and the new way:
`var result = calculator.Add(1, 2, 3, 5, 6)`

#### ref

C# has an equivalent of `&` in C and C++. It is called `ref` but it is hardly used.

```c#
public class M
{
    public void Method(ref int a){
        a += 2;
    }
}

var a = 1;
m.Method(ref a);
```

Now `a` will change because we have used a reference to it and not copied its valued.

#### out

The `out` modifier returns multiple values to the caller even if the method has a `void` return call. This is not a recommended modifier but some methods in the .Net use it.
example:

```c#
int number;
var result = int.TryParse("abc", out number);
if(result)
    Console.WriteLine(number);
else
    Console.WriteLine("Conversion failed.");
```

If we want to avoid `out` we can use `int.Parse()` and use `try {} catch{}` blocks.

### Exceptions

To check whether we have a null object or not, to prevent bugs, we can throw exceptions:
`if (null) throw new ArgumentNullException("");`

## Fields

### Initialization

So one approach to initialize a field was to initialize it in the constructor.
It is best to initialize our fields only if we have values passed from the outside.
We can initialize those fields without the constructor and directly when we define them. Like this:
`List<Order> Orders = new List<Order>();`
This makes it so that no matter how many constructors we have, these fields will always be initialized. regardless of external data.

### Read-only

It can be used on fields, but not on local variables. These fields can either be initialized when declared or at the constructor of our object. This keyword ensures that a variable instance or property of an object cannot be modified after initialization, and such attempts will result in an exception. While `const` is initialized at compile time, `readonly` keyword allow the variable to be initialized either at compile time or runtime.
For the `readonly` keyword, the latest value is known by the runtime. For the `const` keyword, the value must be known by compile time.
For more info checkout [this](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/const-vs-readonly-vs-static-csharp) link.
A basic usage of this, is for when we have a list and re-initializing it will erase existing data on it. We declare it as `readonly` so if we re-initialize it, we'll have a compile time error.

# Encapsulation

Hiding data implementation in order to abstract methods and fields and only represent a behavior is called encapsulation.

## Access Modifiers

Access modifiers are a way to control access to a class and/or its members to improve safety.
In C# we have 5 access modifiers:

- Public: There are no restrictions on accessing public members.
- Private: Is the least permissive access level
- Protected: Is accessible within its class and by derived class instances.
- Internal: Internal types or members are accessible only within files in the same assembly. We use this mainly with classes and not their members. In most cases it doesn't make sense to use this on a class.
- Protected Internal: is accessible from the current assembly or from types that are derived from the containing class.
- Private Protected: is accessible by types derived from the containing class, but only within its containing assembly.

In practice, we use `private` fields and provide `get/set` methods as public.
When defining setters, we now have the option to do a validation on our data before assigning it to a field.
By convention `private` fields should start with `_`.

## Properties

A property is a class member that encapsulates a getter/setter for accessing a field.
It helps us create a setter/getter with less code.
instead of creating a set method and a get method separately we can do it like this:

```c#
private DateTime _date;
public DateTime Date
{
  get { return _date; }
  set { _date = value; }
}
```

For examples like this in which we don't have much logic implemented, we can also use ***auto-properties***:
`public DateTime Date { get; set; }`
Here the C# compiler cerates a `private` field for us internally and we don't have to do that.
Sometimes we only need to set a value at initialization and it is not logical to set another value to the field later, like an birthDate field which only needs to be set once and cannot be changed.
in properties we can simply omit a set or a get. That way we can have read-only or write-only field.
But in auto-properties, we can't do that. So we make the `set` value `private`. In a `private` setter, the only way to set a value to a field, is to use the constructor. After the constructor is run, we cannot change that fields value.

### Note

In C# 5 and earlier, to give auto implemented properties an initial value, you have to do it in a constructor.
Since C# 6.0, you can specify initial value in-line. The syntax is:
`public int X { get; set; } = x; // C# 6 or higher`
`DefaultValueAttribute` is intended to be used by the VS designer (or any other consumer) to specify a default value, not an initial value. (Even if in designed object, initial value is the default value).
At compile time `DefaultValueAttribute` will not impact the generated IL and it will not be read to initialize the property to that value (see [DefaultValue attribute is not working with my Auto Property](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1980520/defaultvalue-attribute-is-not-working-with-my-auto-property)).
Example of attributes that impact the IL are `ThreadStaticAttribute`, `CallerMemberNameAttribute`, ...

### Difference between Properties and public variables

Explained [here](https://blog.codinghorror.com/properties-vs-public-variables/)

### Private setters

In c# 6 or higher, this: `public int Votes { get; private set; }`
is equal to this: `public int Votes { get; }`

properties with private setters are backed by a mutable field, while a getter-only property is backed by a readonly field. This means that a getter-only property is truly immutable, and can only be set in the constructor (or using auto-property initializers), while a property with a private setter can be mutated inside the class.

## Indexers

Indexers are a way to access elements in a class that represent a list of values. like arrays and lists, which we can use like `arr[0]`, `list[3]`.
Some classes have collections semantics. Like `HttpCookie` class.

An indexer is basically a property as shown above.
To create an indexer we act like making a property:

```c#
public type this[type value]
{
  get { ... }
  set { ... }
}
```

instead if an identifier we use the `this` keyword. inside the brackets we have the type of the indexer. The indexer is the value which we want to find out objects with. For example in arrays we find our elements with `int`.

We use the `Dictionary` data type to store key value pairs.
